# Welcome!

This is the development repository of __IsoriX__, an [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package aiming at building isoscapes using mixed models and inferring the geographic origin of organisms based on their isotopic ratios.

## How to download and install IsoriX?
You will soon be able to download and install the stable version of IsoriX by typing:

```
#!R
install.packages("IsoriX")
```


You can download and install the development version of IsoriX by typing:

```
#!R
devtools::install_bitbucket("courtiol/IsoriX_project/IsoriX")
```

## Where to learn about IsoriX?

Here, on bitbucket, we are planning to provide documentation in [our Wiki](https://bitbucket.org/courtiol/isorix_project/wiki/Home). It is just starting, so check regularly for updates.

Otherwise, within IsoriX, you can access to the package documentation by typing:

```
#!R
help(package="IsoriX", help_type="html")
```

and you can also find our tutorials by typing:

```
#!R
browseVignettes(package="IsoriX")
```


## How can you contribute?
There are plenty way you can contribute! If you are fluent in R programming, you can improve the code and develop new functions. If you are not so fluent, you can still edit the documentation files to make them more complete and clearer, write new vignettes, report bugs or make feature requests.
